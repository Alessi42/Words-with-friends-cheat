# Words-with-friends-cheat
A simple python script that chooses the best possible word to play in words with friends

**Note:** this does not take into consideration the state of the board only what the best words to play are

This will take an input of the words that are available on the board say if the board only had the word `words` in the middle you can create a word of any of those letters so for available tiles you would put `words` then you would enter your hand say `uoeada` then the script will print a list of`(the score of the word, the word, and the letter it braches off)` in this example `(7, 'aoudad', 'd')` which is another term for Barbary sheep. huh ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
